Insights
In the 4th group, 'set' stands out with a high proportion already on promotion.
In the 1st and 2nd top groups, 'kurta' ranks second. Despite being on 'no promotion,' it has high sales volume, suggesting that implementing promotions could further increase sales.
For 'set,' since promotions are overwhelmingly high, maintaining or increasing the current status of promotions is necessary to boost sales.
Considering the moderate sales of 'Western Dress' in the top groups, promotions for 'Western Dress' should be carried out.
In the lower group, 'Western Dress' sales are not high. Therefore, promotions focused on 'set' and 'kurta' seem preferable for the lower group.

Conclusions

The Amazon Sales dataset is a valuable resource for businesses and researchers alike.
It provides a wealth of information about customer behavior, product trends, and market conditions.
By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this dataset, businesses can gain valuable insights that can help them make better decisions about their products, marketing, and operations.
During this EDA exercise, we have achieved several milestones: -* We have cleaned the dataset from null values.*
No duplications found in the data.
